We provide nightly builds of **llama.cpp** with **AMD ROCm™ 7** acceleration based on TheRock - delivering the freshest, cutting-edge builds available. Our automated pipeline specifically targets seamless integration with [**🍋 Lemonade**](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade) and similar AI applications requiring high-performance GPU inference.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Contribution & Support Notice**: While this project currently focuses on integrating llama.cpp+ROCm in a specific production context, our broader goal is to contribute meaningfully to the llama.cpp+ROCm ecosystem. We're not set up to provide comprehensive technical support, but we welcome collaborations, idea exchanges, or contributions that help advance this space.

## 🎯 Supported Devices

This build specifically targets the following GPU architectures:
- **gfx1151** (STX Halo GPUs) - Ryzen AI MAX+ Pro 395
- **gfx120X** (RDNA4 GPUs) - includes AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT/GRE/9070, RX 9060 XT/9060
- **gfx110X** (RDNA3 GPUs) - includes AMD Radeon PRO W7900/W7800/W7700/W7600, RX 7900 XTX/XT/GRE, RX 7800 XT, RX 7700 XT/7700, RX 7600 XT/7600

**All builds include ROCm™ 7 built-in** - no separate ROCm™ installation required!

## 🚀 Automated Builds

Our automated GitHub Actions workflow creates nightly builds for:
- **Windows** and **Ubuntu** operating systems
- **Multiple GPU targets**: `gfx1151`, `gfx120X`, `gfx110X`
- **ROCm™ 7 built-in** - complete runtime libraries included

## 🧪 Quick Smoketest

To verify your download is working correctly:

1. **Download** the appropriate build for your GPU target from our [latest releases](https://github.com/aigdat/llamacpp-rocm/releases/latest)
2. **Extract** the archive to your preferred directory
3. **Test** with any GGUF model from Hugging Face:

```bash
llama-server -m YOUR_GGUF_MODEL_PATH -ngl 99
```

> **💡 Tip**: Use `-ngl 99` to offload all layers to GPU for maximum acceleration. The exact number of layers may vary by model, but 99 ensures all available layers are offloaded.

> **🍋 Lemonade Integration**: You can also test these builds directly with [**Lemonade**](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade) for a seamless AI application experience *(coming soon!)*
